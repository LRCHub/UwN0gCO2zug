I rest my eyes
On the open field
A silver line
To heaven's gate
My mind is blank
It's a state I know
Where all I see is hate
I raise my head
To retain my wrath
The savage force
That lives inside of me
Foe to foe
One will die and one will be
And I pray she holds my soul
Can you hear me calling?
Silent goddess won't you
Conduct my fear away
Silent goddess won't you be
Closer when I hate
The battle cries
And the sound of steel
Another quest
For holy land
Some true belief
In each open wound
In Luna's light the lonely victor stands
And I hope she holds my soul
Can you hear me calling?
Silent goddess won't you
Conduct my fear away
Silent goddess won't you be
Closer when I hate
Silent goddess will you
Forever be the same
Silent goddess can you
Feel this heart pulsate
You know that I die for belief
I swear by the sword in my hand
The sum of the pain and the grief
Is nothing compared to the
Wealth I obtain
And the spirit of god can expand
