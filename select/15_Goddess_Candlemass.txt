"YOU'RE THE IDOL, THE SANCTUM OF MY PRAYERS
THE HALLOWED WATER, THE ANCHOR AND THE SAVIOUR
WORTHY SHEPHERD, THE BEARER OF US ALL
OH ASSEMBLER, THE CENTRE OF MY WORLD
SO I'M STANDING HERE BEFORE YOU
WITH SUN IN HAND, A NEW DAY
IT'S NOT A DREAM, I DO ADORE YOU
DO YOU REALLY FEEL BETRAYED?
HUMBLE MESSENGER, THE HAVEN, PERFECTION
THE SACRED WORD, BIRTH AND RESURRECTION
PIOUS PROPHET, CREATOR AND DESTROYER
LAW AND LAMB, THEN THROWN ON THE PYRE
SO I'M STANDING HERE BEFORE YOU
WITH SUN IN HAND, A NEW DAY
IT'S NOT A DREAM, I DO ADORE YOU
DO YOU REALLY FEEL BETRAYED?
YOU'RE NOT MY GODESS, NO FACE OF RELIGION
AND YOU ARE NOT THE BLOOD, NO OCEAN INSIDE US
I SEE YOU AS WITCH, THE ENEMY THAT FINDS US
OUR TEARS FALL LIKE CRYSTAL, INTO THE FIRE
SO I'M STANDING HERE BEFORE YOU
WITH SUN IN HAND, A NEW DAY
IT'S NOT A DREAM, I DO ADORE YOU
DO YOU REALLY FEEL BETRAYED?
IN YOUR EYES, I AM DEMON
BUT I COME AS A FRIEND
OH YOUR PATH OF WAR AND WORSHIP
THE BEGINNING OF THE END"
