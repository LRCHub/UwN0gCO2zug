I've been talking to myself
I don't know where I'm at
Lie to me, undress me
Are you happy now?
I want this pain to be gone
But nobody can help me
The endless fear will grow
Yeah I'm the storm
that never dies
So
You'll never know this
You'll never know this
You'll never know how hard I tried
Tell me that this is not the end
Everything means nothing when you're not here
Sorry I'm goddess who waned to be loved
Dance in the darkness
Fall into sadness
Now will you fix me up?
I gave you my whole life
なぞっているこのヒビを
I want this pain to be gone
But nobody can help me
The endless fear will grow
Yeah I'm the storm
that never dies
So
You'll never know this
You'll never know this
You'll never know how hard I tried
Tell me that this is not the end
Everything means nothing when you're not here
Sorry I'm goddess who waned to be loved
how many times will I try to find peace
どこまで行っても
You can not touch me
'Cause I'm so icy babe
私はひとり
how many times will I try to find peace
どこまで行っても
You can not touch me
'Cause I'm so icy
ただ愛されたい
You'll never know this
You'll never know this
You'll never know how hard I tried
Tell me that this is not the end
Everything means nothing when you're not here
Sorry I'm goddess who waned to be loved
Sorry I'm goddess
I waned to be loved
