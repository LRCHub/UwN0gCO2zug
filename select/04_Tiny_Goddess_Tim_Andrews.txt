Tiny goddess wrapped in lace
That certain smile upon your face
Is telling me what's to be when you leave

In a room just five foot eight
I sit alone and I will wait
To hear from you if you do decide to

Don't try to humour me
With letters I can't read
Don't sympathise with me
Don't try to be discreet

Photograph that's in my case
Will travel with me every place
Reminding me what's to be for your love

Orchards smell of sweet perfume
The mountainside is now in bloom
And I am here waiting for your company

Don't try to humour me
With letters I can't read
The clock's at half past three
It's stopped to wait like me
