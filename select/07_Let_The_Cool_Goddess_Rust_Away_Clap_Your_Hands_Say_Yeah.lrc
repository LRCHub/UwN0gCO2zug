[00:22.73] I found
[00:24.91] A new face
[00:29.54] A new image staring back at me
[00:35.58] Let the cool
[00:39.30] Goddess rust away
[00:44.08] Let the cool
[00:45.08] Goddess rust away
[01:23.45] You so different
[01:34.24] In a different way
[01:38.59] But what goes up has so far down to fall
[01:44.74] So go salvage
[01:48.21] Some of that human dignity
[01:53.09] It'll be a hard road
